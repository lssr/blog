<p> I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.umd.edu">University of Maryland</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/517/Hugh-Bruck">Prof. Hugh Bruck</a>. My research focuses on distortion and residual stress prediction in 3D printed metallic parts.</p>

<p> Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Quicken Loans and as a Structures Engineer at Aeroman before getting a Fulbright Scholarship to pursue graduate studies.</p>
